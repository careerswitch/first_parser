# star5.py

Took me three days to do it but I have put together a parser to csv code to get locations of starmarket stores in Massachusetts.
Want to build up on it for actual use. Have a couple of things in mind. I am sure there is an easier/faster code for this.
If so I am open to constructive criticism. Always eager to learn.
